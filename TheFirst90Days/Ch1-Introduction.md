#### Understanding the Fundamental Principles

Research Conclusion: **Early-wins** is an essential part to gain trust and accelerate the the break-even point.

- **Q:** How to identify early-wins and achieve them?

Framework:

- **Prepare yourself (with a refreshed setup mindset)**: What you had successful may not be the right assumption to directly apply in your new role/situations/context.
- **Accelerate your learning!!!**: climb the learning curve as fast as you can. Learn:
  - business goals (market, customers)
  - organization visions
  - products, technologies, systems, structures
  - culture and politics
- **Match your strategy to the situation**: A clear diagnosis of the situation is an essential prerequisite for developing your action plan.
- **Secure early wins**:
  - First few weeks: identify opportunities to build personal credibility
  - First 90 days: identify ways to create value and improve business results (Define busienss results?? May work with leader on this?)
- [TODO] **Negotiate success**: up-management on:
  - set up the alignment on situation
  - expectation
  - working style
  - resources
  - personal development
  - **Set up and gaining consensus on a 90-days plan**
- **Achieve alignment**:Play the role of organizational architect. Alignment on strategic direction, develop skills & processes to achieve/realize your strategic intent.
  - **Q:** what is a strategic intent/direction? How to define & figure these out?

- **Build your team**: evaluate, align, and mobilize its members (note: may not apply to me, but more like a SDM/leader's action).
  - note: SDE takeaway: identify/learn the right peoples for asking right questions / resolving right problems.

- **Create [coalitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition#:~:text=A%20coalition%20is%20a%20group,together%20to%20achieve%20a%20goal.)**: ability to influence ppl beyond your team is also critical to your success. Identify:
  - **[onboarding 1:1 question]**: Key persons from which their support is essential for your success.
  - Then figure out how to line them up on your side. (turn them to your supportive alliances)
 
- **Keep your balance**: Keep your equilibrium and preserve your ability to make good judgments.
 - Keep a right advice-and-counsel network! (E.g. build a network of advisors, mentors)

- **Accelerate everyone!**: The fact that you're in transitions means your teammates are too. Empower your teammates!
