### Basic Concepts Questions

An apparent **effect** is statistically significant if it is **unlikely** to have occurred by **chance**.

- what is "chance"
- what is "unlikely"
- what is "effect"

### General Structure for testing statistical significance

- **Null hypothesis**: a model of the system based on the assumption that the apparent effect was actually due to chance
- **p-value**: the probability of the apparent effect under the null hypothesis
- **Interpretation**: conclusion that if the effect is either statistically signifiicant, or not
- 
Similarly, to test a hypothesis like, “This effect is real,” we assume, temporarily, that is is not. That’s the null hypothesis. Based on that assumption,
we compute the probability of the apparent effect. That’s the p-value. If the p-value is low enough, we conclude that the null hypothesis is unlikely to
be true.

i.e. p-value discrebed the probabilty of observing an effect at least as extreme as the observed apparent effect -- if null hypothesis is true, we should have a high p-value (i.e. very likely to observe such an apparent effect by one time of observation), otherwise, either we observed a very un-likely apparent effect by chance, or the null-hypothesis is false.
